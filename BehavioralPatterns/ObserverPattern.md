ðŸ”” What is the Observer Pattern?
The Observer pattern is like a subscribe/notify system.

Imagine a YouTube channel:

You (the user) subscribe to a channel.

Whenever the channel uploads a new video, you get notified.

If you unsubscribe, you wonâ€™t receive any more notifications.

In programming, this is used when:

One object (the Subject) changes.

It needs to notify all other objects (the Observers) that are watching it.

âœ… Why Use It?
Keeps objects loosely coupled.

Useful when multiple parts of your app need to react to a single change.

ðŸ§  Key Components
Subject (Observable) â€“ the object being watched (e.g., YouTube Channel).

Observer â€“ the object that wants updates (e.g., Subscriber).

Notification Mechanism â€“ the way Observers get updates when the Subject changes.
