The Strategy pattern is a way to organize your code so that you can easily switch between different methods or algorithms for doing a task. Think of it like having several tools in a toolbox—each tool (or strategy) does a similar job in a slightly different way, and you can choose which one to use depending on the situation.

Here's a simple explanation:

Common Interface:
First, you create a common interface that defines a method (or methods) that every strategy must have. This way, no matter which strategy is chosen, the code using it knows how to interact with it.

Different Strategies:
You then implement this interface in different classes, each providing its own version of the method. For example, if you're sorting numbers, one class might implement bubble sort while another implements quick sort.

Context Uses the Strategy:
Next, you create a context class that holds a reference to one of these strategy objects. The context class doesn't need to know the details of how the strategy works—it simply calls the method defined by the interface.

Changing Strategies at Runtime:
At runtime, you can choose which strategy to use. This means you can change the behavior of the context class without altering its code, just by swapping out the strategy object.

This pattern is useful when you have multiple ways of performing a task and you want to keep your code flexible and easy to maintain. Instead of writing a lot of conditional code to decide which algorithm to use, you simply switch the strategy object based on the situation.
